	"description": "IQ Perfetto Hair Dryer is the most advanced blow dryer in the world. Every single aspect of the IQ Dryer as been engineered to create the ultimate experience. It packs an unmatched blowing power in the most compact design and lightest weight. Engineered in Italy by the world leader in hairdryer, the IQ by Gama has been created with both the hairstylist and the consumers in mind, It offers unparalleled performances.The most powerful blow dryer with a motor speed of 110,000 RPM with 3-speed levels is 7x more powerful than other hairdryers. Only 78db of noise level, which is incredibly quiet for any hairdryer.Its brushless motor not only reduces the drying time but significantly increases the lifetime of your dryer, thanks to its intelligent digital technology.We designed the IQ dryer with the Venturi effect in order to significantly multiply the airflow without using extra power.Ultra-Lightweight, we managed to reduce the weight of the IQ Perfetto’s weight to a mere 294 gr / 10.3oz. You can now dry your hair without tiring your arms. Hairstylists will love the freedom to create haircuts with such a lightweight dryer. Our hairdryer comes with the Oxy Active technology which acts as an anti-bacterial and also a sealant for hair cuticles. The result is shiny and healthy hair after each use.We wanted to create a hairdryer with an extended lifetime and that would keep its performances throughout its life cycle. We introduced the microfilter and auto-clean technology. The microfilter is an advanced filter that prevents the smallest particles to enter the motor without losing its power.The auto-clean technology efficiently extracts all the particles from the dryer by rotating its turbines in the opposite direction.5 temperatures, 3-speed levels, and cool shot.The IQ pro dryer comes with 1 Diffuser and 2 Concentrator Nozzles (96mm & 68mm)Our Memory Function Technology can save up to 18 configurations between speed and temperature. You can easily access them through the digital interface.We have also included a safety lock button to avoid accidental button activation during use.Because we are so obsessed with details, we included a 3m / 9.9ft long power cord, so you can say goodbye to your extension cords.",

Maybe you want *just* enough volume and texture with *just* a hint of shine. Maybe your signature style is more classic than cutting-edge, more natural than notice-me-now. If so, there’s a product for that. Our forming cream delivers medium, workable hold and mid-line shine to make hair look dope but not dramatic. It adds volume and texture to countless styles, from slick side parts to scruffy quiffs, without making hair stiff or sticky. Great for all hair types, our forming cream is the MVP of both laid-back and polished styles.Key FeaturesBoosts volume, creates texture, and adds a natural, medium shineSoft, medium-hold formula lets you restyle throughout the dayNon-sticky, no hard-hair feel, washes out easily leaving no residueLight, creamy consistency won’t weigh down fine or thin hair typesLeaves hair looking impeccably groomed and smelling great tooWhy It’s a Game-ChangerTrends come and go, but your individual style is forever.

Medium hold and a natural finish are what this cream does best, making it a versatile product for all hair types and simple, short styles.

It defines the strands, creating touchable texture that gives your style character. Hair feels soft, not stiff, and can be reshaped as often as you like because hey, diversity is trending. Enriched with glycerin, the formula makes the most of even thin and fine hair, adding definition without revealing too much scalp or weighing the hair down.In fact, this is an ideal styling cream for fine hair as it generates natural-looking volume. Short, slicked-back pompadours and conservative side parts will be perfectly groomed with a little lift. Modern fades with longer tops and sophisticated Ivy League cuts will be bumped up but not too voluminous. This cream also offers medium hold that keeps your style secure until you decide to switch things up.With its water-based formula, our hair holding cream washes out easily to prevent product build-up. It leaves behind no residue that can make hair look dull and unclean. We say, there’s nothing average about medium volume, texture, shine, and hold. Our forming cream is ideal when you want a hairstyle that doesn’t shout from the rooftops.Size: 150ml.How to UsePlace a small amount of forming cream in your palmRub your hands together to warm the cream and make it workableApply evenly throughout the hair to create your desired styleStyling TipsBoth modern and vintage-inspired cuts will benefit from our forming cream.

Boasting a refreshing fragrance too, this product is sex appeal in a pot.Our cream gel comes in various pot sizes to suit your needs.

It’s ideal for keeping unruly, natural hair in place. It’ll also help your hair building fibers stay put for longer. Whether you want a product to spritz on before stepping out to hustle, or a finishing spray to elevate your client’s experience – this is The One.We’ve introduced our spritz holding spray, now let’s talk about the hold. It’s not so soft that you’ll need to reapply every hour. What a pain in the undercut that’d be. And it’s not so strong that it creates the crispy stiffness best left in the early noughties. Instead, this spritz has a flexible hold that lasts all day long, without making hair feel sticky or hard. The formula is lightweight and gentle, leaving no unsightly and gross residue. It keeps frizz and flyaways in check too, so even wild hair types stay sleek.Flexibility is great for natural hair, but what about the fake stuff? Our spritz is an excellent fiber hold spray, as it locks fibers in place for a neat and lasting finish. It also adds a hint of shine that doesn’t look greasy or overly glossy. So even if you’ve filled in the blanks or built up a style with powdered fibers, hair will look natural and healthy.Of course, the key to great-looking hair is to protect it before you even start styling. Used on dry or damp hair, our spritz helps to prevent damage caused by heated styling tools and the sun’s rays. Protection, hold, shine… we told you this spray was a multitasker.100ml. Soft hold strength rating. All-day hold.How to Use:Shake can well before useHold can 18 inches away from hairSpray lightly and evenlyReapply as needed",

	"description": "L3VEL3 HARD WAX BEADSWax on, wax off for smoother skin. Face and body wax beads made with purifying carbon.Whether you’re into DIY hair removal or you own a professional salon, waxing is a sure-fire way to smoother skin. While waxing used to be a drama with messy products and tricky application, we’ve simplified the process. Without the need for strips, our hard wax beads whip hair out at the root to leave skin baby-soft and smooth. The wax simply peels away, taking hair with it and simultaneously exfoliating the skin thanks to the black carbon formula. The wax can be used on face and body, from nasal hair to hair-down-there. Results are instant and long-lasting, so anytime can be nekkid time.Key FeaturesFast and easy application with no strips needed for flawless resultsRemoves unwanted hair from the root for long-lasting smoothnessMade with carbon black wax to remove impurities for clearer skinGentle on delicate skin, can be used on face and body for all hair typesMess-free, convenient, and great value for home and barber shop useWhy It’s a Game-ChangerUsing our wax beads for hair removal is a no-brainer. With no strips needed, these beads offer an easy, mess-free way to banish unwanted hair on face and body.

What’s more, you have complete control over how much wax you use, so you can effortlessly perform both full-body and precision waxes.Wait – no strips? You heard right. These are peel-off wax beads that don’t require any separate strips. You simply melt the appropriate number of beads, apply the wax to the skin and leave it to harden, then peel it and the unwanted hair away. It’s fast, it’s fuss-free, but it yields unbelievably smooth and long-lasting results. The wax is tough on stubborn hair but gentle on delicate areas and can be used on all hair and skin types.Them beads, they be black, and there’s a reason for that. They’re made of carbon black wax, which is a fancy way of saying they’re charcoal-based. Charcoal wax beads not only remove hair from the root but also exfoliate dead cells and detoxify the skin for extra silky-smoothness. With no impurities left behind, the skin can recover quickly and fully after waxing, with a reduced risk of infected follicles.Mess-free, convenient, effective, and great value, these hard wax beans are ideal for self-care and salon clients.

	"description": "L3VEL3 PINK PEEL-OFF FACE MASKChoose our kaolin-enriched pink facial mask for clearer, smoother, petal-soft skin.When your pores need deep-cleaning and your complexion’s looking dull, think pink. Treat your skin to a mask that blitzes dirt and dead skin cells, levels-up your glow, and is super-satisfying to use. We’re talking about our pink peel-off mask. Do not underestimate this stuff; it may look pretty, but it’s tough on gunky pores. Enriched with kaolin clay, it draws out impurities and blackheads (seriously – you can see ‘em!) and soaks up excess oil for a clearer complexion. With natural seed extracts plus an anti-aging effect, this mask leaves skin soft, smooth, and radiant. Smudge it on for selfie-ready skin with #nofilter needed.Key FeaturesEnriched with kaolin clay to draw out dirt, impurities, and blackheadsSoaks up excess oil to leave your complexion balanced, clean, and pureActive ingredients help to protect skin cells for an anti-aging effectEasy (and satisfying!) to use and is great for oily and acne-prone skinPink color will look cute in your before-and-after skincare selfiesWhy It’s a Game-ChangerOur pink peel-off face mask is the most satisfying way to cleanse your skin. It goes on like a dream but is the worst nightmare of dirt and impurities. The active ingredients – including kaolin clay – get deep into your pores to extract blackheads and all the other stuff that’s messing with your glow. It’s thirsty for excess oil too, effectively purifying your skin for a fresh-faced look. It protects healthy skin cells and your youthful beauty… and it’s pink, which instantly makes it 1000% more lust-worthy.Using our pink mask for blackheads is a no-brainer. Apply it to the areas most prone to blackheads (usually your T-zone), let it dry… then peel it off and prepare to be shook. This is the gross-but-satisfying way to deep-clean congested skin. With regular use, you’ll suffer fewer pimples and blackheads, and instead notice a softer, smoother, cleaner complexion. Pro tip: Take before and after photos of your skin, trust us.The kaolin clay in this pore cleansing mask is a great ally for oily skin. It mops up the excess oil that can make your face look dirty and greasy, leaving behind pure and balanced skin. Your complexion will glow from your new-found radiance and confidence, not from built-up oil. And speaking of glow-ups, this mask makes skin look younger, by preventing cell damage and having an immediate brightening, smoothing effect.You can’t ignore the color of our kaolin clay peel-off mask, either. It’s a sweet shade of pink that’ll give you heart-eyes and look cute in selfies on the ‘Gram. So make our peach rose mask the star of your self-care regimen and you’ll be wowed by the results. Clearer, smoother, more radiant skin is yours in a blink of pink.Size: 250mlHow to UseWash your face with warm water to open up the poresApply an even layer of product, leaving it thicker at the edgesAllow the mask to dry completely for 20 minutesGently start peeling the mask off your skin, starting from the edgesRinse your face with cold water once the mask is fully removed",

	"description": "The history of Proraso products dates back a long way. In 1908, Ludovico Martelli from Florence, Italy founded a cosmetics company under his own name. Then in 1948, his son Piero joined the company and helped launch the Proraso “crema miracolosa” to the Italian public. This eucalyptus oil based “miracle cream” could be used both before shaving to soften and prepare the beard, or after shaving to heal and calm irritation. Millions of “vasi” (glass jars) have been sold to three generations of satisfied Italian men and although many people know Proraso for their wonderful Shaving creams, Aftershave lotions and balms, it was the Pre & Post Cream that catapulted the company to the immense success they enjoy today. The Proraso Pre & Post formula will offer your skin a wonderful cooling sensation but more importantly it will make your shave more enjoyable by providing lubrication and cushion that prevents cuts and helps to achieve that “baby butt” smooth shave. Highly recommended!Size: 100ml in a glass jar.Made in Florence, Italy.",

	"description": "Balancing both comfort and sharpness, Derby Double-Edge Safety Razor Blades have been made using some of the most modern manufacturing technologies available. Despite this, Derby razor blades remain compatible with all traditional safety razors, ranging from Merkur to Weishi. Their cutting edges have been coated using ceramic, chromium, platinum, and tungsten, deposited there using a process called sputtering. Combined, these materials help protect the cutting edges from rust while also increasing their hardness for better retention of sharpness. Derby razor blades must undergo rigorous inspections at each stage of their manufacture to pass muster. Once those inspections are complete, each one is packaged using wax paper to keep out moisture before being put into the sealed containers. Azmusebat is the Turkish manufacturer that sells its razor blades under the Derby name. Possessing state-of-the-art facilities, Azmusebat is able to maintain a strong position in the Turkish market for both lighters and safety razor blades. 100 blades Made In TurkeyThis Item is Eligible for Bulk Pricing Click Here",

They can be seen especially on face and other parts of the body after shaving, waxing and epilation. During shaving and epilation there can be a sharp hair cut which causes razor bumps by curling back of hair into the skin. In the treatment of razor bumps, needless and/or tweezers can be used (leads to pain and infection  or at more chronic cases laser treatment can be done (effective but expensive solution). Gummy Bump Repair extensively cleanses skin and removes  the accumulated dirt and oil the skin by using formula which contains salicylic acid powered by willow bark extract. It restrains ingrown hair and razor bumps by preventing the lubrication of hair follicles, and helps to get better the existing razor bumps. At the same time, it helps to prevent irritation and redness of the skin, after shaving and epilation.",

	"description": "Protect your stuff and style up your station with this anti-slip, heat-resistant matYour barber stuff takes a beating throughout the day. Styling tools get dropped and hair products get spilled… the list of potential hazards is enough to make your quiff quake. Aside from the prospect of damaged tools, “messy” is not a good look, and a cluttered workspace will slow you down. Thankfully, our barber station mat is designed to protect your tools and surfaces against damage while making your station more efficient. Made of heat-resistant silicone, this mat brings a new level of protection, safety, and utility to your workspace.Key FeaturesProtects clippers, scissors, blades, and more against scratches and scuffsMade of flexible, grippy, anti-slip silicone so it stays put on your stationHeat resistant, making it a great resting spot for your hot styling toolsHigh quality at a low price and a great size for your workspaceEasy to clean - because hygiene is important in your barber shopWhy It’s a Game-ChangerYour barber tools and work surfaces may be heavy-duty, but they’re not immune to scratches, scuffs, and other damage. So we’ve developed this frankly awesome barber station mat, which takes the worry out of working in a busy shop. The silicone material cushions your tools and stops hot styling irons from melting your countertop. The mat stays put on polished surfaces and adds a little flair too with its embossed-logo design.Silicone has outstanding protective qualities, making it the optimal material for a barber mat. Flexible but hard-wearing, silicone stands up to heavy, abrasive tools and high temperatures. Your clippers, scissors, carbon combs, and razor blades will be well protected by the smooth and cushiony material. In turn, your worksurface will be safe from scratches, scorching, and sticky hair products. A spotless station = a more professional vibe.Of course, a silicone heat-resistant mat is no use if it slides like you into that girl’s DMs. So our version has an anti-slip finish to keep it in place while you work. With good grip on both sides, it’ll hold on to your worksurface and your shiny tools. It’s a great size for your barber cart (or a fancy side table if that’s how you roll). And with that repeating L3VEL3 logo design, it’ll bring style to your space and spark conversation about your fine taste.Our barber tool mat is the ideal finishing touch to your work station, delivering functionality and convenience with a splash of style. Spills and debris wash away easily, to help you maintain good barber shop hygiene and a professional front. What’s more, this mat is high-quality and high-end (impressive), but affordable enough to buy in bulk (recommended).Dimensions: 15.7” x 11.8”.How to UsePlop the mat on your work stationAdmire how good it looksRest your tools on the mat between usesBe shook by how the silicone protects your stuffRepeat",

	"description": "No pain, all gain with our hair clamps that grip tightly without tugging.The secret to flawless hair is effective drying and styling, so parting the hair into manageable sections is a must. When you’re juggling a hairdryer and a heated styling tool, you need a clip that swiftly gets stubborn hair sections out of the way. Our claw clips are cleverly designed to grip hair tightly without causing damage or scalp pain. They feature double-row teeth and a robust spring mechanism for strong hold no matter how thick the hair. With four in the pack, these clips are perfect for home and barber shop use, and for sectioning or accessorizing the hair.Key FeaturesPack of four multipurpose clips for sectioning and styling hairEach side features hard and soft teeth with rounded edgesReinforced springs for strong grip with no tugging or tanglingLarge size can handle all hair types, textures, and thicknessesGreat value, lightweight yet durable clips for home and salon useWhy It’s a Game-ChangerThe humble hair claw just got an upgrade, courtesy of L3VEL3. We’ve developed a clip that grips hair securely but doesn’t tug or tear delicate strands. Our ingenious double-teeth design and strong jaw mechanism make light work of sectioning long, thick, and curly hair. There are four clips in the pack, representing the great value you’d expect from us. And because looks are important (call us shallow) we’ve made these clips suitable for everyday accessorizing and professional use.Squeeze open one of these jaw clips and check out those teeth. There are two rows of teeth on each side of the clip: one row of flexible teeth and one row of hard. The double-up design ensures every strand is secured in place but doesn’t cause the hair to get caught or pulled. The rounded tooth edges are gentle on the scalp, making these clips as comfortable to wear as they are easy to use.Comfort really is the buzzword with these large claw clips. Despite the reinforced springs that give excellent grip, they don’t pull the hair at the root. The clips are durable to withstand repeated use, but they’re also lightweight to prevent that unpleasant “yanked hair” feeling. You know the one. If you’re using these clips as fashion accessories, you can wear them all day in pure comfort.A large hair claw as a fashion statement? Yep – these clips are super-stylish in black with L3VEL3 branding in white. So whether you’re looking for professional-grade clips for your barber shop or something sleek to give your hairstyle flair, these claws work. They’re strong but gentle and capable of wrangling even the thickest hair into submission.Dimensions: each clip is 4” wide.How to UseSqueeze the clip until the jaws openCarefully grip the section of hair between the clip’s teethStop squeezing and start being impressed at the powerful gripNow, you can get to work styling the hair or just rock your look",
